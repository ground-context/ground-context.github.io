Ground is an open-source, vendor-neutral data context service under development
in [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu)'s [RISE
Lab](http://rise.cs.berkeley.edu). *Data context* is all of the information
surrounding the use of data in an organization, and Ground enables users to
understand **what** data they have, **who** is using that data, **when** and
**how** data is changing, and to & from **where** the data is moving. We
believe that data context services are broadly applicable, including use cases
in data inventory, model-specific interpretation, workflow reproducibility,
interoperability, and collective governance.  Ground is based on a versioned,
graph data model. To learn more about the design principles behind Ground,
please look at our [CIDR 2017](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017)
[publication](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p111-hellerstein-cidr17.pdf).

The Ground project is a community effort and includes collaborators from
[Capital One](https://capitalone.com), [Awake
Networks](http://www.awakenetworks.com/), [Skyhigh
Networks](https://www.skyhighnetworks.com/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com), and
[Trifacta](http://www.trifacta.com).
